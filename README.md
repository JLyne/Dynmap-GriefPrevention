# Dynmap-GriefPrevention

Dynmap-GriefPrevention is an addon for Dynmap and GriefPrevention
which displays GriefPrevention claims on your Dynmap instance. It
has a configuration, though the plugin works brilliantly out of the
box.

This resource was created by mikeprimm, though I have forked it to
let it work on the latest Minecraft versions, and improve parts of
the code.
